Creating a Python-based web application that can run on Nginx with container-based deployment using Kubernetes (K8s) involves several steps. You'll need to create the web application, containerize it, and then deploy it on Kubernetes. Here’s a step-by-step guide to accomplish this.

Step 1: Create the Python Web Application
First, we'll use Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, to create a simple web application. Here’s the basic structure of our project:

/python-k8s-app
|-- app.py
|-- Dockerfile
|-- requirements.txt
|-- k8s
|   |-- deployment.yaml
|   |-- service.yaml
|-- nginx
|   |-- nginx.conf

Experimental version of the app
|-- app1.py
|--index.html

|-- RBCA
|   |--service-account.yaml
|   |--role.yaml
|   |--role-binding.yaml

Step 2: Dockerize the Flask Application
Create a Dockerfile in the project root

Dockerfile:

Step 3: Nginx Configuration
Create an Nginx configuration to act as a reverse proxy

nginx/nginx.conf:

Step 4: Kubernetes Deployment and Service
Create the Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files

k8s/deployment.yaml:
k8s/service.yaml:

type: NodePort: This changes the service type to NodePort, which makes Kubernetes map a port on each node to the service.
nodePort: 30007: This is the port on which the service will be accessible from outside the cluster on each node. You can specify any port here between 30000-32767 (default range for NodePorts in Kubernetes) or let Kubernetes assign it automatically by omitting this line.


Step 5: Build and Push the Docker Image

docker build -t yourdockerhubusername/python-app:latest .
docker push yourdockerhubusername/python-app:latest

Step 6: Deploy to Kubernetes

kubectl apply -f k8s/

======================================================================================

To ensure a comprehensive deployment of your application, including proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and setting up Nginx as an Ingress controller, follow these additional steps:

Step 1: Setup RBAC for Your Application
To allow your application to access the Kubernetes API, you need to set up RBAC that defines roles and role bindings for your service account. This will ensure your application has the necessary permissions to query the Kubernetes API.

1. Create a Service Account:
Create a service account for your application in Kubernetes:service-account.yaml:

2. Define a Role with Required Permissions:
Create a role that grants the necessary permissions. Here we grant read-only access to certain resources:role.yaml:

3. Bind Role to Service Account:
Create a RoleBinding to bind the Role to the Service Account:role-binding.yaml:

4. Update the Deployment to Use the Service Account:
Modify your deployment file to use the newly created service account:Add to deployment.yaml:

spec:
  serviceAccountName: python-app-sa

5. Deploy RBAC and Service Account:

kubectl apply -f service-account.yaml
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
kubectl apply -f role-binding.yaml
